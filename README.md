# MSthesis
Here I have uploaded a few codes from my MS thesis work. The work deals with the prediction of galaxy redshifts using photometric fluxes and galaxy morphology.

I have used the Stripe82X and GAMA DR2 datasets.

In the folder BFGS, you'll find a code for a neural network written from scratch which uses the l-BFGS optimiser.

In the folder Adam, you'll find a code for ensembled neural networks with adam optimiser, boosted with XgBoost regressors.
